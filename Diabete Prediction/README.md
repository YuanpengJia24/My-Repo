### Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to build predictive models to identify diabetes cases based on clinical health metrics. Both classification and clustering techniques are employed to explore different methods of diabetes prediction. This project serves as a practical application of machine learning concepts in the context of healthcare.

### Dataset

The dataset for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set). To view data visualizations, users should upload the dataset to their local or cloud environment.

**Dataset Description:**
- Features include measurements such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI.
- The target variable categorizes patients as diabetic or non-diabetic.

### Project Structure

This notebook is structured into seven key parts:

1. **Part 1: Data Description**
   - Provides a conceptual overview of the dataset, detailing feature types, target variable characteristics, and dataset structure.

2. **Part 2: Data Exploration**
   - Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations and statistics.
   - Includes descriptive statistics and data visualization to examine relationships and distributions, guiding feature selection for modeling.

3. **Part 3: Supervised Learning**
   - Compares six machine learning algorithms: Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees, Random Forests, and AdaBoost.
   - Employs cross-validation techniques (5-fold, 10-fold, stratified) with hyperparameter tuning to evaluate and optimize model performance on the binary target variable.

4. **Part 4: Unsupervised Learning**
   - Implements clustering techniques to identify patterns and group similar instances, exploring potential groupings that may exist within diabetic and non-diabetic categories.

5. **Part 5-7: Reflections and Insights**
   - Summarizes the effectiveness of different models and clustering techniques, discussing insights, challenges, and potential areas for further work.
